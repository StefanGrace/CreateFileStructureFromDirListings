This program takes the TXT file that Karen's Directory Printer outputs, and creates the original file structure, either with just the folders, or with the folder and empty versions of the files. It will also set the correct date modified and date created for the folders and files if they are present in the dir listing TXT. It can also add the file size to the start or end of the file names.
